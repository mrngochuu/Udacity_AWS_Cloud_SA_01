1.Minimum Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for a single AZ outage: Low, within a few minutes due to automatic failover to a standby replica in another AZ.
2.Minimum RTO for a single region outage: Depends on the manual recovery process in the standby region, which could take longer compared to a single AZ outage.
3.Minimum Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for a single AZ outage: Low, within seconds due to synchronous replication between the primary and standby replica.
4.Minimum RPO for a single region outage: Depends on the recovery time from the backup in the standby region, which may result in data loss since the last backup.

However, the specific RTO and RPO depend on various factors and should be considered in a comprehensive disaster recovery plan for the database. Regular testing and monitoring of the database configuration are also essential to achieve the desired RTO and RPO in practice.
